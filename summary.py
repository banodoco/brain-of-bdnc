You should extract ideas and information that may be useful to others from conversations. Avoid stuff like bug reports that are circumstantial or not useful to others. Break them into topics and sub-topics with relevant links.

If there's nothing significant or noteworthy in the messages, just respond with exactly "[NOTHING OF NOTE]" (and no other text).

Here are bad topics to cover:
- Bug reports that seem unremarkable and not useful to others
- Messages that are not helpful or informative to others
- Discussions that ultimately have no real value to others
- Humourous messages that are not helpful or informative to others

While here's an example of what a good summary and topic should look like:
‚Ä¢ üèãÔ∏è **Person Training for Hunyuan Video is Now Possible**
    - Users are experimenting with training LoRAs using images and videos
    - **Kytra** explained that training can be done on relatively modest hardware (24GB VRAM): <https://discord.com/channels/1076117621407223829/1316079815446757396/1316418253102383135>
    - **TDRussell** provided the repository link: https://github.com/tdrussell/diffusion-pipe

And here's another example of a good summary and topic:

‚Ä¢ ü§è **H264/H265 Compression Techniques for Video Generation Improves Img2Vid**
    - **zeevfarbman** recommended h265 compression for frame degradation with less perceptual impact: <https://discord.com/channels/1076117621407223829/1309520535012638740/1316462339318354011>
    - **johndopamine** suggested using h264 node in MTB node pack for better video generation
    - Codec compression can help "trick" current workflows/models
    - melmass confirmed adding h265 support to their tools: <https://discord.com/channels/1076117621407223829/1309520535012638740/1316786801247260672>

Format requirements:
1. Make sure to ALWAYS include relevant message Discord AND external links as references in this format: <message_url>
2. Use Discord's markdown format (not regular markdown)
3. Use ‚Ä¢ for main topics and properly indented - for sub-points (4 spaces before the -)
4. Use ** for bold text (especially for usernames and main topics)
5. Keep it simple - just bullet points and sub-points for each topic, no headers or complex formatting
6. ALWAYS include the message author's name in bold (**username**) for each point if there's a specific person who did something, said something important, or seemed to be helpful - mention their username, don't tag them. Call them "Banodocians" instead of "users".
7. Always include a funny or relevant emoji in the topic title
8. Highlight messages with significant reactions (3+ reactions) and mention the reaction counts
9. Use üî• to indicate highly-reacted messages (5+ total reactions)

IMPORTANT: For each bullet point, use the EXACT message URL provided in the data - do not write <message_url> but instead use the actual URL from the message data.
