# Comprehensive Community Rules

```1. Respectful Communication:

    • No directing offensive language at others.
    • Keep discussions focused on AI art and technology — no political or religious debates or content.
    • Feedback is encouraged, but keep the tone constructive and supportive.
    • Do not share personal information without consent.```

```2. Open-Source Values:

    • This space is for people who believe in open-source technology and want to work on it, promote it, and create art with it.
    • It's strongly encouraged that you share code, insights, and resources with others — after all, that's the purpose of the space.```

```3. NSFW Content:

    • NSFW content may only be posted in specifically designated NSFW channels.
    • No content involving minors or anyone who looks like they could be a minor. 18+ only.
    • No content featuring celebrities, politicians, or anyone without their explicit consent.```

```4. Sharing and Credit:

    • Anything posted here may be shared elsewhere, but must include attribution to the original creator with a direct link to their work or profile.
    • If you share something, make sure you're comfortable being responsible for it in the unlikely event it gets followed up on.```

```5. Respect:

    • Encourage and uplift one another. Criticism should aim to help, not tear down.
    • Don't dismiss or belittle others' work — everyone contributes differently.```

```6. Moderation and Subjective Judgment:

    • Not everything that affects the quality of a community can be captured by strict rules alone.
    • Moderators may exercise subjective judgment to preserve the atmosphere of the community.
    • We will always explain our reasoning on any moderation decisions publicly in <#1475121919484366962> and aim to be as sparing and fair as possible.```
