## Community Rules:

> ### 1. Open-Source Values:
> • This space is for people who believe in open-source technology and want to work on it, promote it, and create art with it.
> • It's strongly encouraged that you share code, insights, and resources with others — after all, that's the purpose of the space.
> • Sharing things you've made is encouraged. Promoting paid products or services is not what this space is for.
> • All messages sent here are stored and publicly accessible — for LLMs to learn from and for people to find. If you wish your messages to be deleted, please contact <@301463647895683072>.

> ### 2. Communication and Respect:
> • No directing offensive language at others.
> • Keep discussions focused on AI art and technology — no political or religious debates or content.
> • Feedback is encouraged, but keep the tone constructive and supportive.
> • Don't dismiss or belittle others' work — everyone contributes differently.
> • Do not share personal information without consent.
> • If you have an issue with another member, contact a moderator rather than escalating publicly.

> ### 3. Sharing and Credit:
> • Anything posted here may be shared elsewhere by others unless they've opted out. To change your sharing preferences, use the `/update_details` command with <@1316765722738688030>.
> • If someone has opted out, you'll see a "No Sharing" role on their profile. If they haven't opted out, you can share their content so long as you give proper attribution with a direct link to their work or profile.
> • If you share something that's sensitive from a copyright perspective, make sure you're comfortable being responsible for it in the unlikely event it gets followed up on.

> ### 4. NSFW Content:
> • NSFW content may only be posted in specifically designated NSFW channels.
> • No content involving minors or anyone who looks like they could be a minor. 18+ only.
> • No content featuring celebrities, politicians, or anyone without their explicit consent.

> ### 5. Moderation and Subjective Judgment:
> • Not everything that affects the quality of a community can be captured by strict rules alone.
> • Moderators may exercise subjective judgment to preserve the atmosphere of the community.
> • We will always explain our reasoning on any moderation decisions publicly in <#1475121919484366962> and aim to be as sparing and fair as possible.
