```6. Moderation and Subjective Judgment:

    Our primary goal is to maintain a space that people genuinely enjoy being part of. While the rules above cover clear-cut situations, not everything that affects the quality of a community can be captured by strict rules alone.
    Moderators may exercise subjective judgment to preserve the overall atmosphere and experience of the community. When we do, we will always explain our reasoning and aim to be as sparing and fair as possible.
    At the end of the day, fostering a welcoming, enjoyable space sometimes requires discretion beyond what any rulebook can define.```
