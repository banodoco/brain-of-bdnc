## Community Rules:

> ### 1. Open-Source Values:
> • This space is for people who believe in open-source technology and want to work on it, promote it, and create art with it.
> • Sharing things you've made is encouraged, especially code, insights, and resources. Promoting paid products or services is not what this space is for, unless they also happen to be open source.
> • All messages sent here are stored and publicly accessible — for LLMs to learn from and for people to find. If you wish your messages to be deleted, please contact <@301463647895683072>.

> ### 2. Communication and Respect:
> • Don't direct offensive language at others.
> • Keep discussions focused on AI art and technology — no political or religious debates or content.
> • Feedback is encouraged, but keep the tone supportive and constructive — don't dismiss or belittle others' work.
> • Don't share personal information without consent.
> • If you have an issue with another member, contact a moderator rather than escalating publicly.

> ### 3. Sharing and Credit:
> • Anything posted here may be shared elsewhere by others unless they've opted out. To change your sharing preferences, use the `/update_details` command with <@1316765722738688030>.
> • If someone has opted out, you'll see a "No Sharing" role on their profile — don't share their content publicly.
> • When sharing others' content, give proper attribution with a direct link to their work or profile.
> • If you share something that's sensitive from a copyright perspective, make sure you're comfortable being responsible for it in the unlikely event of a copyright claim.

> ### 4. NSFW Content:
> • NSFW content may only be posted in specifically designated NSFW channels.
> • No content involving minors or anyone who looks like they could be a minor. 18+ only.
> • No content featuring celebrities, politicians, or anyone without their explicit consent.

> ### 5. Moderation and Subjective Judgment:
> • Not everything that affects the quality of a community can be captured by strict rules alone.
> • Moderators may exercise subjective judgment to preserve the atmosphere of the community.
> • We will always explain our reasoning on any moderation decisions publicly in <#1475121919484366962> and aim to be as sparing and fair as possible.
