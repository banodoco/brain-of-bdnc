# Comprehensive Community Rules

```1. Respectful Communication:

    • No Attacks or Harassment: No directing offensive language at others.
    • Stay On Topic: Keep discussions focused on AI art and technology — no political or religious debates or content.
    • Inclusivity: Embrace diversity in all communications.
    • Constructive Feedback: Feedback is encouraged, but keep the tone constructive and supportive.
    • Privacy: Do not share personal information without consent.```

```2. Open-Source Values:

    • Purpose: This space is for people who believe in open-source technology and want to work on it, promote it, and create art with it.
    • Give Back: It's strongly encouraged that you share code, insights, and resources with others — after all, that's the purpose of the space.```

```3. NSFW Content:

    • Designated Channels Only: NSFW content may only be posted in specifically designated NSFW channels.
    • No Minors: No content involving minors or anyone who looks like they could be a minor. 18+ only.
    • No Real People: No content featuring celebrities, politicians, or anyone without their explicit consent.```

```4. Sharing and Credit:

    • Attribution Required: Anything posted here may be shared elsewhere, but must include attribution to the original creator with a direct link to their work or profile.
    • Copyright Is On You: If you share something, make sure you're comfortable being responsible for it in the unlikely event it gets followed up on.```

```5. Respect:

    • Value All Contributions: Every member plays a vital role, whether developing models, creating tools, or producing art.
    • Be Supportive: Encourage and uplift one another. Criticism should aim to help, not tear down.
    • Celebrate Wins: Recognize milestones and achievements within the community.```

```6. Moderation and Subjective Judgment:

    • Beyond the Rules: Not everything that affects the quality of a community can be captured by strict rules alone.
    • Discretion: Moderators may exercise subjective judgment to preserve the atmosphere of the community.
    • Transparency: We will always explain our reasoning and aim to be as sparing and fair as possible.```
