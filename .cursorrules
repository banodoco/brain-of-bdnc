# Project Understanding
- When asked to make a change, try understand what the user needs. If they ask you to search, use the tools. If you need to understand the structure, look at `structure.md` to understand where to make changes. If needed, search up the relevant file for context. Try to find and use common components if they exist.
- Use `structure.md` to understand where to make changes and file purposes.
- Find and use common utilities in `src/common/` before creating new ones.
- After each change, ask yourself "Did I unintentionally delete or edit something out of scope?"

# Code Quality Review
When reading or modifying code, proactively flag potential issues:
- **Duplication**: Similar logic that should be abstracted to `src/common/`
- **God files**: Files doing too much (>300 lines is a warning sign)
- **Mixed concerns**: Discord event handling mixed with business logic (split into `_cog.py` + core module)
- **Inconsistent patterns**: Code that doesn't follow established patterns in the codebase
- **Missing error handling**: Async operations without proper try/except or error logging
- **Stale abstractions**: Utilities that exist but aren't used consistently

Mention these as brief observations - don't derail the task, just flag for awareness.

# Architecture
- **Discord.py**: Uses `commands.Bot` with cogs. Features are modular in `src/features/[name]/`.
- **Feature structure**: Each feature has a core logic file (e.g., `reactor.py`) + a `_cog.py` for Discord integration. Complex actions go in `subfeatures/`.
- **Database**: Supabase only (SQLite removed). All DB access through `src/common/db_handler.py`.
- **LLM clients**: Use factory in `src/common/llm/__init__.py`. Implementations: Claude, OpenAI, Gemini.
- **Logging**: Always use `logging.getLogger('DiscordBot')` for centralized logging (logs to console + Supabase).

# Key Patterns
- **Reaction workflows**: Configured via `REACTION_WATCHLIST` env var (JSON). All reaction/attachment-triggered actions route through `src/features/reacting/reactor.py`.
- **Discord utilities**: Use helpers from `src/common/discord_utils.py` (e.g., `safe_send_message`) for consistency and error handling.
- **Error handling**: Use utilities from `src/common/error_handler.py` (e.g., `@handle_errors` decorator).
- **Data models**: Pydantic schemas in `src/common/schema.py` for DB serialization.
- **Storage**: Direct Supabase writes via `storage_handler.py`, queries via `supabase_query_handler.py`.

# Environment Variables
Key env vars: `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, `REACTION_WATCHLIST` (JSON), `DEV_MODE`.
Never hardcode secrets - always use `os.getenv()`.

# Testing Before Major Changes
Before committing significant changes, test locally with dev mode (fast + repeatable):
```bash
python main.py --dev --summary-now
```
Notes:
- **Dev mode always posts** (ignores “already summarized today” checks).
- **Dev mode does not write to `daily_summaries`** (so you can re-run repeatedly without DB cleanup).
- The bot will keep running after the initial summary; stop it with Ctrl+C when done.

If you need to validate production behavior (skip-if-exists + DB writes), run without `--dev` and point the non-DEV env vars at your test server/channel IDs.
If you need to re-run prod summaries for the same date, use:
```bash
python main.py --clear-today-summaries --summary-now
```

**Viewing logs** (logs are stored in Supabase with 48h retention):
```bash
# Quick health check (errors, summary status, bot activity)
python scripts/logs.py health

# Check daily summary status
python scripts/logs.py summary                   # Today
python scripts/logs.py summary --date 2024-12-12 # Specific date

# View errors
python scripts/logs.py errors                    # All errors
python scripts/logs.py errors --hours 6          # Last 6 hours

# Real-time tail
python scripts/logs.py tail
python scripts/logs.py tail --level WARNING      # Warnings and above

# Search and view
python scripts/logs.py search "rate limit"       # Search by content
python scripts/logs.py recent -n 50              # Last 50 logs
python scripts/logs.py stats                     # Detailed statistics
```

# Git Workflow
- When the user asks to push to github, run `git diff | cat` to figure out what was changed. If there are structural changes (files added/deleted or file purposes changed), update the appropriate place in `structure.md`.
- Then use a single command: `git add . && git commit -m "feat/fix: specific message" && git push`

# Supabase
- Migrations in `supabase/migrations/` with timestamp prefixes (e.g., `20251210000000_description.sql`).
- Query routing/translation is handled by `src/common/supabase_query_handler.py` (SQLite has been removed).
- For OpenMuse media operations, use `src/common/openmuse_interactor.py`.

# Debugging
- Use unique tags like `[ReactorDebug]` - tell user the tag so they can filter console.
- Log values directly: `logger.debug(f"[Tag] message_id: {msg.id}")` not nested dicts.
- **Debug utility**: Use `python scripts/debug.py` for common debugging tasks:
  ```bash
  python scripts/debug.py env               # Check env config for channel ID issues
  python scripts/debug.py channel-info ID   # Details about a specific channel
  python scripts/debug.py deployments       # Analyze Railway deployment issues
  python scripts/debug.py railway-logs -n 100  # Railway platform logs
  python scripts/debug.py logs --hours 1    # Recent logs from Supabase
  python scripts/debug.py messages --channel ID  # Messages from a channel
  ```
- **Add useful debug commands**: When you create a one-off debugging script or command that helps diagnose an issue, consider adding it to `scripts/debug.py` if it would be useful again.
- **Deployment issues**: If the bot stops responding or crashes repeatedly, see `docs/deployment-troubleshooting.md` for diagnostic workflow and common issues.

# Scripts
One-off utilities live in `scripts/`. Run with `python scripts/script_name.py`.

# Don'ts
- NEVER create documentation files (*.md) unless explicitly requested.
- Don't add features beyond what was asked - keep changes focused.
- Don't bypass db_handler with raw Supabase client calls in feature code.
